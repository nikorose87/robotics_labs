    "# Numeric Solution of an Inverse Kinematic Problem using the Newton Method\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse kinematics is a subfield of robotics and computer graphics that focuses on computing the joint parameters necessary to move a robotic arm or character to a particular position. It's called \"inverse\" because it reverses the direction of the kinematic equations, which usually go from joint angles to end-effector position.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Newton method, also known as Newton-Raphson method, is a powerful technique for solving equations numerically. It's an iterative method that starts with an initial guess and then refines that guess using the derivative of the function.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will apply the Newton method to solve an inverse kinematic problem. We will start by defining the problem and the method, and then we will implement the method in Python and use it to solve a specific problem.\n",
