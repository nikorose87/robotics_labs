# Final Project: 4-DoF Robotic Arm with Gripper

**Course:** Robotics
**Professor:** Nikolay Prieto, Ph.D.
**Institution:** Universidad EAN

**Due Date:** June 10th 2024

## Project Overview

This project involves designing, simulating, and constructing a 4-DoF (Degrees-of-Freedom) robotic arm with a gripper. You will utilize Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) to create a complete simulation environment where the robot will catch an object at a known location. The project culminates in 3D printing the robot and demonstrating its functionality in the real world.

## Project Objectives

* Gain experience with robotic arm kinematics and inverse kinematics.
* Utilize ROS2 for robot simulation and control.
* Design and simulate a grasping task in a virtual environment.
* Translate the design into a 3D printable model.
* Build and demonstrate a functioning robotic arm.
* Document the entire process through a comprehensive report.

## Deliverables

1. **GitHub Repository**
   * Your repository must include:
        * ROS2 simulation code for the robotic arm with gripper.
        * Inverse Kinematics calculation with the robotics-toolbox library
        * CAD design files for 3D printing.
        * Any additional resources used in the project (e.g., configuration files, scripts).
2. **Project Report** (LaTeX document recommended)
    * The report should detail the analytical process behind the project. It should cover:
    * Introduction: Project overview and objectives.
    * Literature Review: Background on 4-DoF robotic arms, inverse kinematics, and ROS2.
    * System Design: Details of the robot arm design, including link lengths, joint types, and gripper mechanism.
    * Kinematic Analysis: Mathematical derivation of the forward and inverse kinematics for your specific robot.
    * Simulation Environment: Description of the ROS2 simulation setup, including the object to be grasped and its initial coordinates.
    * Control Strategy: Explain how the robot arm will be controlled in the simulation to achieve the object grasping task.
    * 3D Printing and Construction: Detail the 3D printing process, assembly instructions, and materials used.
    * Results and Discussion: Analyze the simulation results and discuss the functionality of the 3D printed robot. 
    * Conclusion: Summarize the project achievements and highlight key learnings.
    * References: List all resources cited in the report.

## Resources

* Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2): [https://docs.ros.org/](https://docs.ros.org/)
* Open source libraries for robot simulation (e.g., MoveIt!2): [https://docs.progress.com/category/moveit-documentation](https://docs.progress.com/category/moveit-documentation)
* Online resources for 4-DOF robotic arm kinematics

## Additional Notes

* Feel free to explore different design options for your robot arm and gripper mechanism.
* Collaboration is encouraged, but each student must submit their own report and repository.
* Document your progress throughout the project. 
* Regularly test your simulation and address any issues that arise.
* Consider safety precautions when 3D printing and assembling the robot.
* The robot is fixed, so make sure you attach the base properly to the ground.
* The work is by the same groups along the semester.
