# 4-DOF Robot Design Project for Mechatronics Course (3 Weeks)

This project outline details the design and implementation of a 4-DOF robot manipulator for a mechatronics design course within a condensed 3-week (21-day) timeframe.

## Project Stages:

### Week 1 (Conceptual Design & Mechanics):

* **Brainstorming & Research (2 days):**
    * Students brainstorm functionalities and applications for their 4-DOF robot.
    * Students research existing 4-DOF robots for inspiration. They can leverage inverse engineering to adapt a design from a web source for their project goals.
* **CAD Design and Drawing sheet (5 days):**
    * Students create a 3D model of their robot using CAD software. This model should include all components like links, joints, actuators, and end-effectors.
    * They create the assembly and individual drawing sheets to make the protoype reproducible. You must accomplish the technical standards from the ISO, ANSI or DIN.

* **Structural Analysis (3 days):**
    * Students calculate critical forces and moments acting on each link using free-body diagrams and equilibrium equations, focusing on core concepts for structural integrity.
* **Bill of Materials (BOM) & Fabrication Planning (2 days):**
    * Students create a BOM listing all components needed for the robot, including motors, sensors, controllers, and fabrication materials.
    * Students choose a fabrication method (e.g., 3D printing/laser cutting) based on design complexity and material suitability.

**Week 2 (Control System & Fabrication):**

* **Control System Design (2 days):**
    * Students select a microcontroller board, motor drivers, and necessary sensors based on functionalities. They prioritize components that meet project requirements and are readily available within the timeframe.
* **Programming (3 days):**
    * Students write control code to implement desired functionalities. This may involve libraries for motor control, sensor data acquisition, and communication protocols. Emphasis is placed on code clarity, efficiency, and effective debugging techniques.
* **Fabrication (10 days):**
    * Students fabricate the robot parts using the chosen method, focusing on efficient use of time and resources.

**Week 3 (Assembly, Testing & Documentation):**

* **Assembly & Testing (10 days):**
    * Students assemble the fabricated parts and integrate the control system. They perform comprehensive testing to verify functionalities and identify any issues, prioritizing critical tests within the timeframe.
* **Report Generation (20 days):**
    * Students document the entire design and implementation process in a well-structured report.
        * Project goals and functionalities.
        * Detailed mechanical design with CAD drawings.
        * Summary of key structural analysis findings.
        * Control system design and component specifications.
        * Programming code with explanations, emphasizing clarity and efficiency.
        * Fabrication methods and BOM.
        * Testing results and performance evaluation.

**Deliverables:**

* Functional 4-DOF robot prototype (3D printed or laser cut).
* Comprehensive report in Markdown format documenting the design, analysis, fabrication, control, and programming aspects.

**Learning Outcomes:**

Through this project, students will gain practical experience in:

* Design and analysis of robotic mechanisms, focusing on essential concepts within the timeframe.
* Applying core engineering principles for structural integrity.
* Integrating control systems with hardware, prioritizing efficient component selection.
* Programming for robot control with an emphasis on clarity and debugging.
* Project management and documentation in a compressed timeframe.

**Note:**

* This rubric is a guideline and instructors may adjust weights based on specific course objectives.
* Deductions may be made for incomplete deliverables, safety hazards, or plagiarism.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Emphasize efficient time management and task prioritization throughout the project.
* Provide resources for students to find pre-designed components or simplified FEA analysis examples to save time. 
* Encourage clear communication and collaboration among students for problem-solving and knowledge sharing.
* Offer support for using control system programming tools and debugging code effectively.

This revised plan condenses the project timeline while maintaining a focus on core competencies. By streamlining the structural analysis and fabrication stages, students can still gain valuable experience in mechatronics design and deliver a functional robot prototype within the 3-week timeframe.
